# ZigZag Boilerplate

[documentation](doc.md)

## Whatâ€™s Included?

* Build-in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) support.
* Modern tooling, ES6, SASS and EJS syntax support.
* Global variables between js, scss and html.
* A live development server that warns about common mistakes (powered by `webpack-dev-server` and/or `broswersync`).

npm run format-js #run prettier on your js
```

npm run format-scss #run prettier on your scss

## Features

Most of the features are customizable in the `zigzag.config.js`.

When you follow the folder structure, it give you access to some handy aliases.
You can found them in `webpack/urls.js`.

Adding media has never been so easy !

In javascript, we rely on webpack aliases

```javascript
import myImgPath from '@img/example.jpg'
```

In sass, we inject vars through the `sass-loader`:

```sass
.myDiv {
  background: url("#{$img}/example.jpg")
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyFont';
  src: url(#{$fonts}/example-font.ttf);
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

In html (.ejs), we inject vars through the `htmlWebpackPlugin`

```ejs
<img src="<%= $img %>example.jpg">
```

## Caveats

HMR is enabled by default for all but .html/.ejs. the `htmlWebpackPlugin` does not allow HMR, it can only live reload (reload page on save).


## Linters

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org) :
  * Atom : `apm install linter-eslint`
  * VS Code : `ext install vscode-eslint`
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io) :
  * Atom: `apm install prettier-atom`
  * VS Code: `ext install prettier-vscode`
